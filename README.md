# RAG Project

This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which combines the power of information retrieval and generative models to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Project Overview

The RAG Project is an implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach, where a retriever model is used to fetch relevant documents from a knowledge base, and a generator model uses this information to produce a more informed and accurate response. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where up-to-date or specific information is required to answer questions.

- **app.py**: The main script to run the application, which sets up the API or command-line interface.
- **rag.py**: Contains the implementation of the RAG model.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.
- **runtime.txt**: Specifies the Python version to be used in the environment.
- **.render.yaml**: Configuration file for deployment on Render.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omaymaprojects/rag-project.git
    cd rag-project
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
This will start the application, allowing you to interact with the RAG model either through an API or command-line interface, depending on how app.py is set up.

Deployment
Render
For deployment on Render, the repository includes a .render.yaml file. You can follow the instructions provided by Render for deploying the application. Simply push the repository to a connected Render service, and it will automatically deploy based on the provided configuration.
